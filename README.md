Ethical Warning: This is a full-screen capture which results in an unresponsive display
using pygame.PixelArray & (100) which requires a (possibly unintuitive) force quit. Might
flash repeatedly, might just sit there. Depending on your configuation and load you might
be limited to a (sluggish?) log-off/log-on loop and have to power doown. I've created a
monster.
